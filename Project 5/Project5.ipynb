    "# Project 5: Infinite Impulse Response Filter Design\n",
    "There are four classical IIR filters: (1) Butterworth (2) Chebyshev I (3) Chebyshev II (4) Elliptic. They represent four different combinations of two error approximation measures. The first measure uses the Taylor series while the other minimizes the difference between the desired and actual response over a band of frequencies. \n",
