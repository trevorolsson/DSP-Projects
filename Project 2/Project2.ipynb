    "## Objective:\n",
    "1. We have the difference equation $$ y[n]-1.1y[n-1]+0.46y[n-2]=x[n]+0.04x[n-1]+0.76x[n-2]$$ which can be implemented using the <code>filter</code> command. Find the vectors <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that satisfy this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create an impulse of length 40.\n",
    "    1. Characterize the LTI system by finding the first 40 points of the impulse response.\n",
    "    2. Plot the impulse response with <code>stem</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examine two ways of implementing an LTI system:\n",
    "    1. Create a signal consisting of a 5--point unit height pulse followed by five zeros followed by another 5--point unit height pulse and then zeropadded to a total length of 40.\n",
    "    2. Find the response of the system to an input signal using <code>conv</code> and <code>filter</code>.\n",
    "    3. Are there differences? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examine the frequency response:\n",
    "    1. Find an expression for the frequency response of the system described by the difference equation.\n",
    "    2. Plot the magnitude and phase response of the system.\n",
    "    3. What type of filter does this resemble?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Examine the response to two sine waves:\n",
    "    1. Create two signals $x_{1}[n]=\\cos(0.1\\pi n)$ and $x_{2}[n]=\\sin(0.4\\pi n)$ both of length 100.\n",
    "    2. Filter each signal with the filter in step 1.\n",
    "    3. Examine the frequency response of the system.\n",
    "    4. Add the two signals and filter the sum of the two. Which does the result resemble more, $x_{1}[n]$ or $x_{2}[n]$?"
